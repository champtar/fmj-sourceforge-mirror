<!-- 
   Example of how to use an FMJ player in an applet - version for use with a build. 
   Only pure-Java features are supported in this example, where we assume no special permissions. 
   This applet won't run by loading this html using file:// in your browser, unless you grant the applet
   file read permissions.  Better to serve it up using a web server.
   
   Troubleshooting:
   Set the FMJ logging level to fine, by editing the JRE's logging.properties:
   After:
      .level= INFO
   Add:
      fmj.level=FINE
   And then change:
      java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = INFO
   to:
      java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = FINE
      
   Restart the browser.
   
   Then, open the Java console.  If you don't know how to open the browser Java console, here is a 
   helper plugin for Firefox:

   Note: retroweaver-rt-2.0.jar is only needed for 1.4 compatibility, if using retrowoven jars.
   To use it, add ../lib/retroweaver-rt-2.0.jar to the archive path below.
